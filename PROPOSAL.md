# Project Proposal
For my final project I plan to build a “N-body simulation.” 
The N-body simulation takes a set of bodies or planets and simulates the force of gravity between the two bodies over time. 
Here is a simulation of what mine will hopefully look like: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:N-body_Simulation.ogv. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:N-body_Simulation.ogv)
I will be using the math and graphics modules from openframeworks to help make my project.
My background in physics and CS will help me make this project. I like to think I am decent at physics and I really enjoy it so I will easily understand all the physics that go in to the simulator. In addition many N-body simulator’s use a tree algorithm to help with computation which I have used before in my personal projects and in CS125. Plus, I plan to apply to do researh in either the physics department or cs department next year and the hope is I will be making physics simulations.
