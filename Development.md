// TO DO: development.md, ADD TIME, add vel scalar?, tune variables to represent real world
// optional: add spin/angular momentum, make 3D (spheres), add an option to create our solar system, elastic/inelastic collisions (shatter the planet), better planets (pictures instead of circle), tidal forces

// Problems ran into: timing, sin/cos/asin weren't accurate enough, .assignn for constructor didn't get random, splitting force into componenets, collision distance with different size planets
//							  Fx = proportional way isn't accurate either


// double

//singleton class/pattern, extern in header and cpp or static variable in class
// global variable pattern

// scale velocity

// make a grid
